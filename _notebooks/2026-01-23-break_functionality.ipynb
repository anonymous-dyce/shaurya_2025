    "# Frontend:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The break feature is a calendar functionality that allows users to designate specific dates as \"break days\" (such as holidays, teacher planning days, or scheduled breaks). When a date is marked as a break, any events scheduled on that day are automatically moved to the next non-break day, preventing scheduling conflicts during designated break periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does the Break Feature Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Break Day Declaration**: Users can click on any calendar date and select \"Make Break\" to designate that date as a break day\n",
    "2. **Break Naming**: Each break requires a name (e.g., \"Winter Break\", \"Spring Break\", \"Professional Development Day\")\n",
    "3. **Break Description**: Users can optionally add a description for context\n",
    "4. **Automatic Event Rescheduling**: When a break is created, all events on that day are automatically moved to the next available non-break day\n",
    "5. **Break Visualization**: Break days are displayed with a distinct dark gray (#2a2a2a) background to differentiate them from regular events\n",
    "6. **Break Management**: Users can delete break days, which presumably moves events back or handles them appropriately\n",
    "7. **Break Prevention**: The system prevents creating multiple breaks on the same date\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frontend Architecture & Code Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **State Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let allEvents = [];        // Global array storing all calendar events and breaks\n",
    "let currentFilter = null;  // Tracks the active class filter (CSA, CSP, CSSE, or null)\n",
    "let currentEvent = null;   // Currently selected event in the modal\n",
    "let isAddingNewEvent = false; // Flag to distinguish new event creation from editing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: These variables maintain the state of the calendar application, tracking which events are loaded, what's currently displayed, and what the user is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Data Fetching Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `request()`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Fetches calendar events from `/api/calendar/events`\n",
    "- **Returns**: Promise resolving to array of calendar events\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Returns null on failure, logs errors to console\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `getAssignments()`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Fetches assignment data from `/api/assignments/`\n",
    "- **Returns**: Promise resolving to assignment array\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Returns null on failure\n",
    "- **Note**: New function integrated to fetch assignment data alongside calendar events\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `getBreaks()`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Fetches break data from `/api/calendar/breaks`\n",
    "- **Returns**: Promise resolving to array of break events\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Returns empty array on failure\n",
    "- **Integration**: Specifically designed to retrieve all scheduled breaks from the backend\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Break Utility Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `isBreakDay(dateString)`\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function isBreakDay(dateString) {\n",
    "    return allEvents.some(event => event.isBreak && event.start === dateString);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Checks if a given date has a break scheduled\n",
    "- **Returns**: Boolean (true if date is a break day, false otherwise)\n",
    "- **Usage**: Prevents duplicate breaks on the same date\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `getBreakName(dateString)`\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function getBreakName(dateString) {\n",
    "    const breakEvent = allEvents.find(event => event.isBreak && event.start === dateString);\n",
    "    return breakEvent ? breakEvent.breakName : null;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves the name of a break on a specific date\n",
    "- **Returns**: Break name string or null if no break exists\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used for displaying break information to users\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Data Aggregation: `handleRequest()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the central hub for loading all calendar data. It uses `Promise.all()` to fetch from three endpoints simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "Promise.all([request(), getAssignments(), getBreaks()])\n",
    "    .then(([calendarEvents, assignments, breaks]) => {\n",
    "        // Process all three types of data\n",
    "    });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing Flow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calendar Events Processing**:\n",
    "   - Extracts priority from event title (format: `[P0]`, `[P1]`, `[P2]`, `[P3]`)\n",
    "   - Assigns color based on priority (red for P0, orange for P1, yellow for P2, green for P3)\n",
    "   - Falls back to class-based colors (CSP: blue, CSSE: green) if no priority detected\n",
    "   - Adds `isBreak: false` to distinguish from break events\n",
    "   - Stores in `allEvents` with full event metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assignments Processing**:\n",
    "   - Parses due dates from format `MM/DD/YYYY`\n",
    "   - Converts to standardized date format\n",
    "   - Assigns orange color (`#FFA500`) to all assignments\n",
    "   - Marks with `isBreak: false`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Breaks Processing**:\n",
    "   - Creates special break event objects\n",
    "   - Assigns dark gray color (`#2a2a2a`)\n",
    "   - Sets `isBreak: true` for identification\n",
    "   - Stores break name for reference\n",
    "   - Applies `fc-event-break` CSS class for styling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Calendar Rendering: `displayCalendar(events)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializes the FullCalendar library with:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Toolbar Configuration**:\n",
    "- Navigation buttons (prev, next, today)\n",
    "- Custom class filter buttons (All, CSA, CSP, CSSE)\n",
    "- View options (Month, Week, Day)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Click Handler**:\n",
    "- Populates modal with event details\n",
    "- **Break Event Logic**: For break events, only shows the delete button (prevents editing breaks)\n",
    "- **Regular Event Logic**: Shows both edit and delete buttons for normal events\n",
    "- Disables period and priority fields for viewing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date Click Handler** (Key for break creation):\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "dateClick: function (info) {\n",
    "    const selectedDate = formatDate(info.date);\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // CRITICAL: Check if date already has a break\n",
    "    if (isBreakDay(selectedDate)) {\n",
    "        alert(`There is already a break on ${formatDisplayDate(info.date)}`);\n",
    "        return;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Display modal for new event/break creation\n",
    "    document.getElementById(\"makeBreakButton\").style.display = \"inline-block\";\n",
    "    // ... additional modal setup\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Feature**: The date click handler prevents creating multiple breaks on the same date through the `isBreakDay()` check.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Event Filtering: `filterEventsByClass(className)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function filterEventsByClass(className) {\n",
    "    let filtered = allEvents;\n",
    "    if (className) {\n",
    "        // CRITICAL: Include breaks regardless of filter\n",
    "        filtered = allEvents.filter(event => event.isBreak || event.period === className);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    // Sort with breaks first, then by priority\n",
    "    return filtered.sort((a, b) => { ... });\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logic**:\n",
    "1. If no filter: return all events\n",
    "2. If filter active: return breaks PLUS events matching the class filter\n",
    "3. Sort with breaks always appearing first, followed by events sorted by priority\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Rationale**: Breaks are always visible regardless of class filter because they affect scheduling across all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Break Creation: `makeBreakButton.onclick`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This handler implements the complete break creation workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Validation**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "if (!breakDate) {\n",
    "    alert(\"Please select a date for the break!\");\n",
    "    return;\n",
    "}\n",
    "if (!breakTitle) {\n",
    "    alert(\"Please enter a name for the break!\");\n",
    "    return;\n",
    "}\n",
    "if (isBreakDay(breakDate)) {\n",
    "    alert(`There is already a break on...`);\n",
    "    return;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: User Confirmation**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const confirmation = confirm(\n",
    "    `Are you sure you want to make ${formatDisplayDate(localDate)} \n",
    "    a break day with the name \"${breakTitle}\"? \n",
    "    Events on this day will be moved to the next non-break day.`\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Informs user about automatic event rescheduling\n",
    "- Allows user to cancel before submission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: API Call**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "fetch(`${javaURI}/api/calendar/breaks/create`, {\n",
    "    method: \"POST\",\n",
    "    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n",
    "    body: JSON.stringify({\n",
    "        date: breakDate,\n",
    "        name: breakTitle,\n",
    "        description: breakDescription,\n",
    "        moveToNextNonBreakDay: true  // Triggers automatic rescheduling\n",
    "    }),\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Response Handling**\n",
    "- On success: Display success alert, close modal, refresh calendar via `handleRequest()`\n",
    "- On failure: Display error message with backend response details\n",
    "- Logging for debugging: `console.log()` calls track the break creation payload and response\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Modal UI Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "The modal includes:\n",
    "- **Event Title Display**: Shows \"Add New Event\" for new items\n",
    "- **Date Input**: Read-only display with hidden date picker for editing\n",
    "- **Title Input**: `contentEditable` div that switches between display and edit modes\n",
    "- **Description Input**: `contentEditable` div supporting HTML formatting\n",
    "- **Class Selector**: Dropdown disabled for viewing, enabled during break creation\n",
    "- **Priority Selector**: Only visible for regular events, hidden for breaks\n",
    "- **Action Buttons**:\n",
    "  - `saveButton`: Saves new event/break (shows only during creation)\n",
    "  - `makeBreakButton`: Creates break from event data (shows only during creation)\n",
    "  - `editButton`: Enables edit mode (hides for breaks)\n",
    "  - `deleteButton`: Deletes event or break (shows for all)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Styling & Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSS Classes & Colors**:\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".fc-event-break { background-color: #2a2a2a; border-color: #1a1a1a; }\n",
    ".fc-daygrid-day.break-day { background-color: #2a2a2a; }\n",

    ".priority-p1 { background-color: #ea580c; } /* Orange */\n",
    ".priority-p2 { background-color: #ca8a04; } /* Yellow */\n",
    ".priority-p3 { background-color: #16a34a; } /* Green */\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theme Integration**: Calendar uses CSS custom properties:\n",
    "- `var(--bg-0)`: Primary background\n",
    "- `var(--bg-1)`: Secondary background (alternating rows)\n",
    "- `var(--bg-2)`: Header background\n",

    "  - Input validation for date format and required fields\n",
    "  - JSON request/response formatting\n",

    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Next Non-Break Day Logic\n",
    "When creating a break with `moveToNextNonBreakDay: true`:\n",
    "- The system checks if the next day has a break\n",
    "- If yes, it continues checking subsequent days\n",
    "- Returns the first date without a break\n",
    "- Supports up to 365 days ahead\n",
    "- All events are moved while preserving their properties\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Transaction Safety\n",
    "- All operations are marked with `@Transactional`\n",
    "- Break creation and event rescheduling happen atomically\n",
    "- All succeed or all fail together\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Input Validation\n",
    "- Date format validation (YYYY-MM-DD)\n",
    "- Break name validation (cannot be empty or null)\n",
    "- Duplicate break prevention on same date\n",
    "- Comprehensive error messages\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Error Handling\n",
    "- 400 Bad Request: Invalid input (date format, empty name)\n",
    "- 404 Not Found: Break doesn't exist\n",
    "- 500 Internal Server Error: Server errors with descriptive messages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Break with Multiple Consecutive Days\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create break on 2026-01-27\n",
    "curl -X POST http://localhost:8585/api/calendar/breaks/create \\\n",
    "  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "  -d '{\n",
    "    \"date\": \"2026-01-27\",\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Winter Break\",\n",
    "    \"description\": \"Two week winter break\",\n",
    "    \"moveToNextNonBreakDay\": true\n",
    "  }'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create another break on 2026-01-28\n",
    "curl -X POST http://localhost:8585/api/calendar/breaks/create \\\n",
    "  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "  -d '{\n",
    "    \"date\": \"2026-01-28\",\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Winter Break Continuation\",\n",
    "    \"description\": \"Second week of winter break\",\n",
    "    \"moveToNextNonBreakDay\": true\n",
    "  }'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now events from 2026-01-27 move to 2026-01-29 (skipping 2026-01-28)\n",
    "# And events from 2026-01-28 move to 2026-01-29\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Multiple Dates\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check if 2026-01-27 is a break day\n",
    "curl -X GET \"http://localhost:8585/api/calendar/breaks/is-break-day?date=2026-01-27\"\n",
    "# Response: {\"isBreakDay\":true}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if 2026-01-29 is a break day\n",
    "curl -X GET \"http://localhost:8585/api/calendar/breaks/is-break-day?date=2026-01-29\"\n",
    "# Response: {\"isBreakDay\":false}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
