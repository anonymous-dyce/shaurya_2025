    "## 5 things I did over 12 weeks in Trimester 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary Quiz Grading Backend\n",
    "    - I initially worked on the model and API for a binary quiz\n",
    "    - I created a model that had sections for quiz attempt number and score\n",
    "    - I worked with Rutvik, who saved quiz questions, and Shriya, who worked on frontend\n",
    "    - Shriya took over binary quiz as her feature but my database helped her create her own\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Binary History Full Stack Feature\n",
    "    - My full stack feature displays binary history events and allows users to add events to the list\n",
    "    - My database saves event year and description and connects to frontend using API endpoint\n",
    "    - For frontend, I worked on fetching the events from backend using GET method and displaying them from oldest to most recent\n",
    "    - For interactivity, I created an input at the bottom of the page where users can add their own event to show up in the database\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Binary Trials\n",
    "    - Me and rutvik partnered up to work on a series of games called binary trials \n",
    "        - I had to work on the game where two players had to work as a team to win\n",
    "    - In the game, 2 players take turns answering questions about binary history and have to stay away from each other\n",
    "    - If they touch the game ends, so they must stay away from each other as long as possible\n",
    "    - Due to my game, my full stack feature is now a \"study guide\" for players to memorize the events and add their own to the game\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Collaboration\n",
    "    - This trimester, our team had a rough start and was disorganized in terms of working as group\n",
    "    - Later, we began to have standup meetings and used Slack and iMessages to communicate about progress and issues\n",
    "    - We also helped each other with understanding topics: for instance, I helped my teammate understand parts of Big Idea 4\n",
    "<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/t2feb_img1.png\" alt=\"Binary History\">\n",
    "    - Overall, our collaboration improved significantly, and by the end of this tri we have an organized binary page with each of our games matching an overall theme and a functioning backend UI\n",
    "5. Frontend UX Engineer\n",
    "    - As the Frontend UX Engineer of our group, I helped manage the styling of our overall site and ensure consistency throuhgout the features\n",
    "    - I helped by styling the home page and organizing links that led to other pages so that our home page was organized\n",
    "<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/t2feb_img2.png\" alt=\"Binary History\">\n",
    "    - Additionally, I ensured evreryone's feature had the same styling structure, such as background, text, buttons, textboxes, etc.\n",
    "    - For our binary trials series, I created the trials directory which had a styling consistent to the two features, could be directly accessed by the home page, and had links to our features\n",
    "<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/t2feb_img3.png\" alt=\"Binary History\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## N@TM Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/t2feb_img4.jpg\" alt=\"Binary History\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, N@TM was an amazing experience, as I got to present my individual feature to several students and parents, and I was able to take notice of other people's features, including those from CSP, CSA, and CSSE. I took interest in one of the people's features at the event, Darsh, and I interviewed him about the different parts of his group and individual feature. Additionally, I ran into my friend Nikhil N and he needed help with preparing for the CSP final, so I recorded my conversation with him and helped him prepare for the final.\n",

    "\n",
    "## MCQ:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my test corrections for the questions I got wrong on my MCQ:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topic 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors\n",
    "I got Question 39, Question 58, Question 66, and Question 67 wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are all based on topic 1.4\n",
    "\n",
    "Error in calculating sum\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 39: Assume that the list of numbers nums has more than 10 elements. The program below is intended to compute and display the sum of the first 10 elements of nums. Which change, if any, is needed for the program to work as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response: Line 3 should be changed to REPEAT UNTIL (i ≥ 10). / Making this change to the loop will cause the loop to terminate when i is 10, which does not fix the problem with the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Lines 5 and 6 should be interchanged. / As is, the program does not include the first element of the list in the sum because i is incremented before nums[i] is added to sum. By interchanging these two lines of code, the program will include all of the first ten elements of the list when computing the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error in AnyPairs procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 58: The following procedure is intended to return true if at least two of the three parameters are equal in value and is intended to return false otherwise. For which of the following procedure calls does the procedure NOT return the intended value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response: AnyPairs(\"bat\", \"cat\", \"rat\"), For this set of inputs, the IF condition x = y evaluates to false, so the body of the ELSE statement is executed. The expression y = z evaluates to false, so false is returned as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: AnyPairs(\"bat\", \"cat\", \"bat\"), For this set of inputs, false is returned even though two of the inputs are equal in value. The IF condition x = y evaluates to false, so the body of the ELSE statement is executed. The expression y = z evaluates to false, so false is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error in counting perfect numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 66: In mathematics, a perfect number is a type of integer. The procedure IsPerfect(num) returns true if num is a perfect number and returns false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following program is intended to count and display the number of perfect numbers between the integers start and end, inclusive. Assume that start is less than end. The program does not work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which two lines of code should be removed so that the program will work as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 5: This line should be removed. The variable count should increase by 1 when currentNum is a perfect number, so it should only be incremented in the body of the IF statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 11: This line should not be removed. Every integer from start to end should be checked, so currentNum should be incremented inside the loop but outside the body of the IF statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Line 5, Line 8: This line should not be removed. The variable count should increase by 1 when currentNum is a perfect number, so it should be incremented in the body of the IF statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error in numOccurrences procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 67:\n",
    "The procedure NumOccurrences is intended to count and return the number of times targetWord appears in the list wordList. The procedure does not work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "For which of the following code segments will the call to NumOccurrences NOT return the intended value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. For this code segment, count is increased to 1 the first time “birch” is encountered in the list. However, count is reset to 0 when the code segment moves to the next list element. The last time “birch” is encountered in the list, count is again increased to 1, causing the procedure to return 1 instead of the intended result 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. For this code segment, count is initialized to 0. Since “spruce” does not appear in the list, the procedure returns the intended result 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A and B\n",
    "\n",
    "B. For this code segment, count is increased to 1 the first time “maple” is encountered in the list. However, count is reset to 0 when the code segment moves to the next list element. This causes the procedure to return 0 instead of the intended result 1.\n",
    "Topic 3.11 Calling Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.11: Binary Search\n",
    "Question 47:\n",
    "The procedure BinarySearch (numList, target) correctly implements a binary search algorithm on the list of numbers numList. The procedure returns an index where target occurs in numList, or -1 if target does not occur in numList.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following conditions must be met in order for the procedure to work as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response:\n",
    "I chose The list numList must not contain any duplicate values because I thought binary search should not contain any duplicate values, but in order for a binary search on a list to work as intended, the list must be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topic 3.17 Algorthimic Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Q56: Compare execution times of two versions (Learn how to read them)\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose Version II requires approximately 1 more minute to execute than version I, but the answer was:\n",
    "\n",
    "Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q50: Reasonable time algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Question:\n",
    "Consider the following algorithms. Each algorithm operates on a list containing n elements, where n is a very large integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I: An algorithm that accesses each element in the list twice.\n",
    "II: An algorithm that accesses each element in the list n times.\n",
    "III: An algorithm that accesses only the first 10 elements in the list, regardless of the size of the list.\n",
    "Which of the algorithms run in reasonable time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses:\n",
    "I chose III only because the first 10 elements seemed to run faster than accessing all elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer was all because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm I accesses elements twice (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time.\n",
    "Algorithm II accesses elements n times (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time.\n",
    "Topic 4.2 Fault Tolerence\n",
    "\n",
    "I got Question 44 wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "This question relates to this topic\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove connections in network configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 44:\n",
    "The figure below shows two possible network configurations for devices P through V. A line between two devices indicates a connection. Devices can communicate only through the connections shown. In configuration I, what is the minimum number of connections that must be broken or removed before device T can no longer communicate with device U?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response:\n",
    "Four / Incorrect. While it is possible to disconnect computers U and T by removing four connections, it can be done by removing only two connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Two / Correct. If the connections between U and V and between U and P were removed, then computer T and computer U can no longer communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topic 3.9 Developing\n",
    "\n",
    "I got Question 15 wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "This question relates to this topic\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare output of program A and program B\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 15 Consider the 2 programs below. Which of the following best compares the values displayed by programs A and B?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response: D / Incorrect. Both programs print 10 values\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer A / Correct. Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program B prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.\n",

    "## Retrospective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, this trimester signifantly improved me not just as a coder, but as a member of a team\n",
    "    - My strengths for this trimester were: \n",
    "        - Consistency, as I made sure to meet all requirements before each live review during the tri\n",
    "        - Collaboration, as I collaborated with my teammates so we all had similar styling and UI throughout our site, and I regularly helped people with the frontend of their feature\n",
    "        - Understanding of code: even though I had never coded in Javascript or Advanced Python / SQLite before, I tried my best to understand each line of code in my model, API, and frontend, and I understood how functions such as fetching, posting, schema, etc. worked\n",
    "    - My weaknesses for this trimester were:\n",
    "        - Time management; I would often work on my code and live review requirements during office hours or lunch rather than doing it as homework, because I frequently procrastinated my CSP work at home\n",
    "        - Getting distracted; my teammates would come to me for help frequently and talk about non-CSP related topics frequently, and a lot of the time I would become involved in their conversation and helping them rather than working on my code\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the future, I wish to get an internship for computer science where I can work on full stack projects and use my CSP knowledge, as well as individual learning, to become a successful intern.\n",
    "- I also want to pursue Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as my majors, so that I can combine both my softwarw and hardware skills to work on projects for tech companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection on project by creating next steps plans for strengths and weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps for strengths:\n",
    "- Continue on team collaboration and communication by making the group a safe place to ask questions and promote conversation\n",
    "- Maintain my understanding of the code by spending time after school reviewing the code and connecting the dots of where everything goes even as the code gets harder and harder\n",
    "Next steps for weaknesses:\n",
    "- Time Management: Break whatever I was trying to finish for the day into smaller chunks and take short breaks inbetween so I don’t burn myself out and waste a long time on a break\n",
    "- Not understanding CPT requirements properly: To overcome this I will watch the collegeboard videos in more depth and take notes to really understand what is needed from me\n",
    "- Distractions: Stay focused and on task by looking at the overall picture of what is happening and not getting worried about the small details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection on individual strengths/weaknesses regarding code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "- Complete Full-Stack Integration\n",
    "- Combines frontend (JavaScript, HTML), backend (Flask, Python), and database (SQLAlchemy).\n",
    "- Implements JWT authentication to protect coolfact entries.\n",
    "- Comprehensive CRUD Operations\n",
    "- Enables users to Create and Read events in binary history\n",
    "- Utilizes Fetch API for real-time updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seamless JSON to DOM Handling\n",
    "- Retrieves coolfact data from the backend in JSON format.\n",
    "- Dynamically modifies the DOM to reflect coolfact updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database Management & Restore\n",
    "- Stores history event data persistently using SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "- Includes a restore function to reset or backup data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "- My page looks very bland with only the list , I could have made the page more interactive\n",
    "- My feature is lacking an update and delete function; I initially had one but because it constantly ran into errors, I had to remove it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "I would like for users to be able to look at the previous ages that they had inputted and be able to compare their efficiency in achieving their goal. A visual representation of this would be most effective such as a bar graph or a line graph to show the rate at which they are achieving their goal. To achieve the chart, a function would have to be created so that only integers could be inputted for their age and a function to create and display a graph would have to be created. A spellchecker is something that I believe could enhance the UI of my feature, making the UI more appealing to users and just overall providing a better experience.\n",
    "Things I struggled with over the course of this trimester\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extra: A memorable part of this tri\n",
    "One memorable thing in terms of code over the course of this trimester was getting my API PUT function to work properly. I was constantly getting 500 Internal Server errors. I also struggled a lot to fix the restore function. Every time I would run the restore function, lots of errors would show up. To fix this I did a deep dive into the scripts restore file where I learned that one of the models in the database had a few errors causing the error in restore. I was then able to fix those errors and resolve the issue.\n",
    "To solve these problems I would use debugging methods such as print statements to see where the code was going, and breakpoints to truly understand what the code was doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Self Grade:\n",
    "\n",
    "5 things for DOCSE: 4.8/5\n",
    "- I would give myself this score because even though I worked on multiple projects and stuck to my individual feature a few weeks after the tri started, I was able to gain a lot more experience by working on several features; by working on the backend for quiz grading and my binary history, I now feel more experienced with creating a database schema and making an API endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full stack project demo: 1.8/2\n",
    "- Overall, I feel like my full stack feature meets most of the CPT requirements and is very user interactive, expecially the game I worked on that has become a part of my feature. Also, I was able to present really well at N@TM and got overall positive feedback from the audience. However, I can spend more time trying to understand CPT requirements and how I can develop my project to more specifically align with CPT/PPR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Feature Write-up: 1/1\n",
    "- In my write up I talked about how the different parts of my project align with CPT requirements, such as Input/Output, Algorithmic Code Requests, List Requests, and a Call to Algorithm. I also taked about how my project fulfills my response for the PPR, and how I will answer the FRQs for my feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCQ: 0.75/1\n",
    "- I completed the MCQ, but I had to rush through a lot of the questions as I had procrastinated the exam and did it right before presenting what I would do for my live review (which was 24 hours prior to this). However, I completed most of my test corrections for it, and I spent time understanding the questions I did wrong, even if it was because I rushed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "10th Point: 1/1\n",
    "- I feel like I earned the 10th point because I had a throrough interview redarding Darsh's project and with Nikhil needing help for his final prep. I also talked about my strengths and weaknesses both regarding my code and individual skills, as well as my plans for the future regarding computer science and one memorable thing from this trimester.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall score: 9.35/10\n",
    "- I feel like I made significant improvements throughout this trimester, and because of my ability to consistently deliver good quality code and output, as well as thoroughly explaining connections and applications of my work to collegeboard and class requirements, I believe I deserve this score. During next trimester, I hope to continue to make improvements and strive for success as we go through topics in the Data Structures Course."
