    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The purpose of our group code is to create a site to teach future students and peers:\n",
    "- We will teach how non base-10 numbering systems work\n",
    "- We will explain how different logic systems work, and their names (ex. Xor gate)\n",
    "- We will create a space for students to work together through chats in order to gain understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The purpose of my code is to:\n",
    "- Provide a timeline of the history of binary\n",
    "- Allow users to learn about an essential part of history\n",
    "- Let users share their own knowledge about events related to the history of binary\n",
