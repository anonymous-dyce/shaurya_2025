    "However, the topics that I performed well on were 1.14 (Calling Instance Methods), 3.2 (Impact of Program Design), 3.5 (Methods: How to Write Them), and 4.3 (Array Creation and Access). These are areas of less concern and I only need to review and do some practice on these topics.\n",

    "#### What did I learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Taking this quiz helped me understand the structure of AP CSA exam questions and key topics such as using objects and methods, selection and iteration, and data collections through Java syntax. These questions seem interesting to me and I will make sure to go over the topics, especially of the questions I missed, so that I can do better on future practice exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because I had learned about the fundamentals of programming and syntax, I was easily able to understand more than half of the questions, such as the ones for class creation, using methods and objects, and even some within data collections. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I find Java syntax and functionality to have many similarities to Python, which is why I could use my Python knowledge for many questions where we had to understand code.\n",
