    "The topics that I did not do well on were: 1.15 (String Manipulation), 2.4 (Nested if Statements), 2.8 (for loops), and 4.8 (ArrayList Methods). I need to work on these topics more thoroughly and improve in order to perform better on future MCQs and the AP Exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the topics that I performed well on were 1.14 (Calling Instance Methods), 3.2 (Impact of Program Design), 3.5 (Methods: How to Write Them), and 4.3 (Array Creation and Access). These are areas of less concern, and I only need to review and do some practice on these topics.\n",

    "#### What did I learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Taking this quiz helped me understand the structure of AP CSA exam questions and key topics such as using objects and methods, selection and iteration, and data collections through Java syntax. These questions seem interesting to me and I will make sure to go over the topics, especially of the questions I missed, so that I can do better on future practice exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because I had learned about the fundamentals of programming and syntax, I was easily able to understand more than half of the questions, such as the ones for class creation, using methods and objects, and even some within data collections. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I find Java syntax and functionality to have many similarities to Python, which is why I could use my Python knowledge for many questions where we had to understand code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here is my overall performance on the 11 questions I got wrong, separated by each big idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/csa_prex_mc.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I had the same number of questions wrong for BI 2 and 4, I understood more of the questions in BI 2 than BI 4. BI 3 had roughly the same amount of questions not understood as BI 2, and each BI had one question where I did not understand the question or the concept.\n",

    "## Reflection Timeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the year, I came in with only my rusty CSP knowledge. I had not done any programming as I had gone to India over the summer, and I had to re-look at the code on my recent full-stack project, BioSKANZ. I did not know anything about Java whatsoever and was only content with the Python, SQLite, JavaScript, HTML, and API knowledge I already had.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Tools sprint, I, Arnav, and Ahaan worked on creating new lessons on the open coding society site. I wanted to gain further experience from this sprint, so I worked on integrating Gemini into FRQ questions and having the questions serve as checkpoints between each lesson. I later moved the Gemini prompt/response system, including my API Key, to the spring backend to ensure protection of my key (continued in \"cool feature\" section). \n",
    "\n",
    "During the Java fundamentals (CSA lessons) sprint, I made sure to do all popcorn and homework hacks, including some of the extra credit, as this will help me with my Java knowledge for the rest of the year. Also, it will greatly help me on my AP Exam; as I have already seen, it helped me with many of the questions on the Practice Exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Frontend Quest sprint, I worked on submodule 1 (the overview of frontend). I created a module that was interactive (through FRQ and MC questions, as well as a Synergy Demo), appealing (through colorful styling, headers, and bullet points rather than paragraphs), and easy to understand (covered content at a CSSE/beginner-level CSP comprehension)."
