```Java
/**
 * Calculates the sum of all positive even integers in the given array.
 * <p>
 * The method iterates through each element of the {@code nums} array and adds it to a running total
 * only if the element is greater than zero and evenly divisible by two. The method then returns
 * the final sum.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Preconditions:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code nums} must not be {@code null}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code nums} may contain any integer values (positive, negative, or zero).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Postconditions:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Returns the sum of all positive even numbers in {@code nums}.</li>
 *   <li>If there are no positive even numbers, returns {@code 0}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param nums an array of integers to evaluate
 * @return the sum of all positive even integers in {@code nums}; {@code 0} if none exist
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, -6};
 * int result = doSomething(numbers);  // result = 6
 * </pre>
 */
public static int doSomething(int[] nums) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] % 2 == 0) {
            result += nums[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
}

// Example test to verify output
int[] testArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, -6};
System.out.println(doSomething(testArray));  // Expected output: 6
```

## Popcorn Hack #2:


```Java
/**
 * Manages student grades and calculates final grades based on weighted categories.
 * <p>
 * This class allows teachers or students to track assignments across different categories
 * (such as homework, tests, and projects) and compute a final grade using category weights.
 * It can also handle extra credit and generate a summary report of all recorded data.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Key Features:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Store assignments organized by category</li>
 *   <li>Apply custom weights to each grade category</li>
 *   <li>Track and include extra credit points</li>
 *   <li>Generate formatted grade reports</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Example:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * GradeBook myGrades = new GradeBook();
 * myGrades.setCategoryWeight("Homework", 0.30);
 * myGrades.setCategoryWeight("Tests", 0.70);
 * myGrades.addAssignment("Homework", "HW1", 95.0);
 * myGrades.addAssignment("Tests", "Unit Test 1", 88.0);
 * double finalGrade = myGrades.calculateFinalGrade();
 * System.out.println("Final Grade: " + finalGrade);
 * </pre>
 *

public class GradeBook {
    private HashMap<String, Double> assignments;
    private HashMap<String, Double> categoryWeights;
    private double extraCredit;

    /**
     * Adds an assignment score to a specific category.
     *
     * <p><b>Preconditions:</b></p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code category} and {@code name} must not be {@code null}.</li>

     * <ul>
     *   <li>The assignment is stored under the specified category.</li>

     */
    public String generateReport() { return ""; }
}
```

## Homework Hacks:

### Part 1: Documentation Analysis

Improved Code:


```Java
/**
 * Demonstrates a simple example of adding two integers and displaying the result.
 * <p>
 * This program defines a method {@code add(int, int)} that returns the sum of two integers,
 * and calls it from the {@code main} method to print the result to the console.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example Output:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * ans is 15
 * </pre>
 *
 * @author Ahaan
 * @version 1.0
 * @since 2025-10-07
 */
public class Stuff {

    /**
     * The main entry point of the program.
     * Initializes two integers, adds them, and prints the result.
     *
     * @param args command-line arguments (not used)
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        int y = 10;
        int z = add(x, y);
        System.out.println("ans is " + z);
    }

    /**
     * Adds two integers and returns their sum.
     *
     * <p><b>Preconditions:</b></p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Inputs {@code a} and {@code b} are valid integers.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>Postconditions:</b></p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Returns the arithmetic sum of {@code a} and {@code b}.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param a the first integer
     * @param b the second integer
     * @return the sum of {@code a} and {@code b}
     */
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

I Added Javadoc comments for the class and both methods, used proper class name capitalization, added @param and @return tags for method documentation, provided an example output and clear descriptions of purpose, and I also improved the legibility with correct naming connventions.

### Part 2: Document a Complex Method:


```Java
/**
 * Attempts to enroll a student in a specific course for a given semester.
 * <p>
 * This method checks for various conditions such as course availability,
 * schedule conflicts, prerequisite completion, and credit limits before
 * enrolling the student. If all checks pass, the student and course records
 * are updated, and the enrollment transaction is recorded.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Preconditions:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The student and course records exist in the system.</li>
 *   <li>The semester value is valid (e.g., Fall = 1, Spring = 2).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Postconditions:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The student is added to the course roster and the course is added to the student’s schedule, if successful.</li>
 *   <li>A transaction record is created for the enrollment.</li>
 *   <li>If any condition fails, the enrollment is not processed and {@code false} is returned.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param studentId the unique identifier of the student attempting to enroll
 * @param courseCode the unique code identifying the course
 * @param semester the semester number in which the enrollment occurs
 * @return {@code true} if enrollment succeeds; {@code false} otherwise
 */
public boolean enrollStudent(String studentId, String courseCode, int semester) {
    Student student = findStudentById(studentId);
    if (student == null) return false;

    Course course = findCourseByCode(courseCode);
    if (course == null) return false;

    if (course.isFull()) return false;
    if (student.hasScheduleConflict(course)) return false;
    if (!student.hasPrerequisites(course)) return false;
    if (student.getCreditHours() + course.getCreditHours() > 18) return false;

    student.addCourse(course);
    course.addStudent(student);
    recordEnrollmentTransaction(studentId, courseCode, semester);
    return true;
}
```

### Part 3 Reflection Questions

Even if they didn’t write the code, documentation guarantees that everyone on the team is aware of how it operates. It makes sure long-term maintainability, expedites the onboarding of new members in understanding a project, and helps prevent duplication of effort. Someone might be able to remeber what they wrote in a project they made on your own, but in a team project, the documentation becomes something that anyone can remeber and understand. Documentation should be used when you are doing a complex and less obvious coding task, so people can understand what you are doing. You shouldn’t use documentation for simplier concepts or tasks, the documentation would not be needed in this scenario.
