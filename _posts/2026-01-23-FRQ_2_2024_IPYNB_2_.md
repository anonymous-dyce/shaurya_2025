### Code:


```python
/*
 * Creates and manages a scoreboard for a game between two teams.
 * Game rules:
 * - Teams take turns being active
 * - Scoring points keeps the same team active
 * - Scoring 0 points switches the active team
 */
class Scoreboard {

    // Store team names
    private String team1Name;
    private String team2Name;

    // Store the name of the currently active team
    private String activeTeam;

    // Store team scores
    private int team1Score;
    private int team2Score;

    // Initializes team names, scores, and sets team 1 as active
    public Scoreboard(String team1, String team2) {
        team1Name = team1;
        team2Name = team2;

        team1Score = 0;
        team2Score = 0;

        // Team 1 always starts
        activeTeam = team1Name;
    }

    // Updates the game state based on the result of a play
    public void recordPlay(int pointsScored) {

        // If the play failed, switch the active team
        if (pointsScored == 0) {
            if (activeTeam.equals(team1Name)) {
                activeTeam = team2Name;
            } else {
                activeTeam = team1Name;
            }
        }
        // Otherwise, add points to the active team
        else {
            if (activeTeam.equals(team1Name)) {
                team1Score += pointsScored;
            } else {
                team2Score += pointsScored;
            }
        }
    }

    // Returns the current score and active team
    public String getScore() {
        return team1Score + "-" + team2Score + "-" + activeTeam;
    }
}

/*
 * Main class used to run and test the Scoreboard
 */
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String info;

        // First game
        Scoreboard game = new Scoreboard("Red", "Blue");

        info = game.getScore();
        System.out.println(info);

        game.recordPlay(1);
        info = game.getScore();
        System.out.println(info);

        game.recordPlay(0);
        info = game.getScore();
        System.out.println(info);

        info = game.getScore();
        System.out.println(info);

        game.recordPlay(3);
        info = game.getScore();
        System.out.println(info);

        game.recordPlay(1);
        game.recordPlay(0);
        info = game.getScore();
        System.out.println(info);

        game.recordPlay(0);
        game.recordPlay(4);
        game.recordPlay(0);
        info = game.getScore();
        System.out.println(info);

        // Second independent game
        Scoreboard match = new Scoreboard("Lions", "Tigers");
        info = match.getScore();
        System.out.println(info);

        // Original game is unchanged
        info = game.getScore();
        System.out.println(info);
    }
}
```

### Proof of my Code Running in Code Runner:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024frq2proof.png">

### Code features:

1. State Management: The class uses five variables. While you could use a String to track the active team, using a boolean (like **isTeam1Active**) is more efficient for "toggling" between two states.

2. The Constructor captures the names provided during instantiation. It must also set the initial scores to 0 and ensure Team 1 starts as the active team.

3. State Tracking: Each Scoreboard object stores team names, team scores, and which team is active. Because of this, **Scoreboard game** and **Scoreboard match** can exist independently.

4. In **recordPlay**, the **condition points > 0** handles scoring. The **else** block (when points are 0) uses **isTeam1Active = !isTeam1Active** to flip the boolean, effectively switching the active team.

5. The **getScore** method builds the return string by combining the integers and strings with hyphens. Java automatically converts the integers to strings during this process.

### Areas of struggle: 

One thing I struggled with the most was defining the main method in class Scoreboard. I was able to meet the criteria of the AP Exam problem within 90-100 lines of code, but the main method was not being defined. Creating the method as part of Scoreboard class caused the code to become more than twice as long, which I feel is only necessary for the code runner and not on the AP Exam itself. Other than that, I accidentally switched teams when points were scored rather than when the score was 0, and used the **==** sign instead of **.equals()**.
