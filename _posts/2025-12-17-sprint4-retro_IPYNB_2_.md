## Reflection Timeline:

At the beginning of the trimester, I worked on planning for the upcoming sprint. I helped in breaking down our overall goals and to do list into smaller phases that we could divide up, such as data persistence, theming engine, and theming applications. I listed detailed things we needed to work on for our final product so that we could go from a broad idea presented to us to work on to tangible activities that could be completed (or broken down more into smaller tasks).

Then, I got to work on user preferences. I wanted to help implement user preferences within the Infograph for Tools and Equipment, and that made me realize a bigger issue. The infograph was part of the tailwind css we were using, and tailwind itself was completely disconnected from the dashboard. This was also causing pages like onboarding adventure to incorrectly display preferences. Because of this, I got to work on implementing the preferences within files such as dashboard and infograph, as well as several individual markdown files. I was able to stop bugs from occuring with the home page's text, and even got preferences to show up in the places that were stuck on default styling.

Afterwards (and most recently), I worked on the calculator lesson. My job was to write the lesson for the calculator that would be presented for CSSE onboarding. Although we had conflicts and misunderstandings about the lesson content, I ended up creating the lesson structure with different sections of teaching code, as well as notes and homework hacks.
