## AP CSA Practice Exam:

Here is my performance in each section of the exam:

| Unit                     | Questions Correct (out of total) | Percentage |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Using Objects and Methods | 9 out of 12                     | 75%         |
| Selection and Iteration   | 9 out of 13                     | 69%         |
| Class Creation            | 6 out of 7                      | 86%         |
| Data Collections          | 12 out of 16                    | 75%         |
| **Total**                 | **31 out of 42**                | **74%**     |


The topics that I did not do well on were: 1.15 (String Manipulation), 2.4 (Nested if Statements) 2.8 (for loops), and 4.8 (ArrayList Methods). I need to work on these topics more thoroughly and improve in order to perform better on future MCQs and the AP Exam.

However, the topics that I performed well on were 1.14 (Calling Instance Methods), 3.2 (Impact of Program Design), 3.5 (Methods: How to Write Them), and 4.3 (Array Creation and Access). These are areas of less concern and I only need to review and do some practice on these topics.

I reflected on my performance using the graphs and tables below. These will also help me prepare for future MC exams.

#### What did I learn?

- Taking this quiz helped me understand the structure of AP CSA exam questions and key topics such as using objects and methods, selection and iteration, and data collections through Java syntax. These questions seem interesting to me and I will make sure to go over the topics, especially of the questions I missed, so that I can do better on future practice exams.

- Because I had learned about the fundamentals of programming and syntax, I was easily able to understand more than half of the questions, such as the ones for class creation, using methods and objects, and even some within data collections. 

- I find Java syntax and functionality to have many similarities to Python, which is why I could use my Python knowledge for many questions where we had to understand code.

#### Here is my overall performance on the 11 questions I got wrong, separated by each big idea:

Although I had the same number of questions wrong for BI 2 and 4, I understood more of the questions in BI 2 than BI 4. BI 3 was roughly the same amount of questions not understood as BI 2, and each BI had one question where I did not understand the question or the concept.
