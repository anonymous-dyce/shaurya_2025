## What I’ve Already Studied

So far, I have took a diagnostic exam from my prep book and am studying the topics that I did not do well on (in the diagnostic and/or the 2018, 2021, and 2022 practice AP CSP exams). I've also been reviewing the team teach blogs from my classmates on the Big Ideas 3 and 5 topics that I need to know for the AP Exam.

### Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming

- **Binary Search Algorithms**  
  We studied how binary search provides an efficient method to locate elements in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the list in half. Compared to linear search, binary search offers better performance (O(log n)), and we practiced building it with loops and conditionals.

- **Lists and Filtering Algorithms**  
  We practiced using lists and designed filtering algorithms to extract useful information. These exercises reinforced our understanding of selection and iteration in solving computational problems.

- **Big-O Notation**  
  We learned how Big-O notation helps analyze the efficiency of algorithms, using examples like O(1), O(n), and O(n!). This helped us compare algorithms and understand the importance of writing scalable code.

- **Random Algorithms**  
  We explored how randomness is used in simulations, games, and algorithm design. Discussions focused on balancing fairness with unpredictability, and how random processes can be useful in problem-solving.

- **Simulations**  
  We built simulations to model real-world systems like weather and traffic. These taught us how assumptions, constraints, and variables impact accuracy and decision-making in computational models.

- **Undecidable Problems**  
  We learned that not all problems have algorithmic solutions. The Halting Problem showed us the limits of computation and helped us understand what makes a problem undecidable.

- **Graphs and Heuristics**  
  We used graphs (nodes and edges) to represent relationships, exploring structures like adjacency matrices/lists. We also learned heuristics like the Nearest Neighbor algorithm and heuristic search techniques for complex problems like the Traveling Salesman.

### Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing

- **Beneficial and Harmful Effects**  
  Through case studies on social media’s emotional impact and communication changes, we examined how computing can help and harm society. These discussions highlighted the ethical responsibility of creators and engineers.

- **Digital Divide**  
  We explored how unequal access to technology affects education and employment. This led us to consider ways to promote digital equity across communities.

- **Computing Bias**  
  We looked at how biases can be embedded in algorithms, using examples like facial recognition and hiring tools. We also studied strategies to reduce bias through diverse data sets and fairness checks.

- **Crowdsourcing**  
  We studied platforms like Wikipedia and open-source projects to understand how group collaboration drives innovation—and the challenges it brings, like misinformation and quality control.

- **Legal and Ethical Concerns**  
  We analyzed digital privacy, intellectual property, and ethical dilemmas in AI and data handling. These topics deepened our understanding of responsible computing.

- **Safe Computing**  
  We learned cybersecurity basics: strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and how to recognize phishing attempts. The importance of digital citizenship and smart online behavior was a major takeaway.

## My 3-Week Study Plan

---

### Week 1: CPT Reflection + Big Idea 1 – Creative Development

#### Focus (for Thursday-Sunday):
- Work on CPT reflection questions:
  - Q2: Program purpose and functionality
  - Q3a: Development process
  - Q3b: Abstraction
  - Q3c: Algorithm
  - Q3d: Testing and debugging
- Weak points (from previous MCQ exams) to study:
  - Collaborative and iterative design
  - Incremental development and documentation
  - Solving problems through computing

#### Goals:
- Complete final CPT reflections for feedback on my code
- Self-score using the College Board rubric
- Complete Big Idea 1 review in prep book
- Study PPR Responses and functions of Program Code this weekend
  - Create Flashcards on different parts of my code for self quizzing
- Complete CPT review in prep book

---

### Week 2: Big Idea 2 – Data

#### Focus on weak points from previous MCQ exams:
- Data collection, analysis, and visualization
- Large datasets and how they support discoveries
- Metadata, lossy/lossless compression
Other topics to study afterward:
- Large datasets and how they support discoveries
- Bias in data, data filtering, and cleaning

#### Goals:
- Submit CPT (PC, PPR, Video) BY TUESDAY NIGHT (at the very most)
- Create flashcards for key terms
- Complete 3–5 AP Classroom progress checks
- Complete Big Idea 2 review in Prep Book
- Get at least one Big Idea 2 problem set done externally

---

### Week 3: Big Idea 4 – Computer Systems and Networks

#### Focus:
- Internet structure: IP, DNS, and packet switching
- Redundancy, fault tolerance, and scalability
- Cybersecurity and encryption basics

#### Goals:
- Run a simulated packet routing activity
- Take 1-2 full-length practice AP CSP exams

---

### Week 4: Monday-Wednesday
- Take at least 3 practice AP exams from prep book
- If there are questions I continue to get wrong, thoroughly revise the topic to make sure I understand it
- On Wednesday, thoroughly review CPT code, video, and PPR and ensure my responses to reflection questions

---

## To do this, I will:
- Use AP Classroom and the Khan Academy course (which I have already started studying) for continued practice, especially for Big Ideas 1, 2, and 4
- Practice writing CPT reflection questions
- Use resources such as CrackAP and Varsity Tutor Tests to do more practice problems related to CSP to reinforce Big Ideas 1-5 in time for my AP Exam
- Study my Barron's AP Computer Science Principles Prep Book to practice the topics I am weak on and to get exam tips for each topic and idea
