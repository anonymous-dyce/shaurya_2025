### Popcorn Hacks 1-4


```python
member_one = "Arnav"
ethnicity = "Indian"

member_two = "Lars"
grade = 12

member_three = "Weston"
is_from_us = True
```


```python
fruits = {
    "apple": {
        "color": "red",
        "shape": "venn diagram",
    },
    "banana": {
        "color": "yellow",
        "shape": "crescent",
    },
    "orange": {
        "color": "orange",
        "shape": "sphere",
    },
    "grape": {
        "color": "green",
        "shape": "ellipse",
    },
    "strawberry": {
        "color": "red",
        "shape": "rounded-edge cone",
    }
}

for x,y in fruits.items():
    print("A(n)", x, "has the following attributes:\n", y)
```

    A(n) apple has the following attributes:
     {'color': 'red', 'shape': 'venn diagram'}
    A(n) banana has the following attributes:
     {'color': 'yellow', 'shape': 'crescent'}
    A(n) orange has the following attributes:
     {'color': 'orange', 'shape': 'sphere'}
    A(n) grape has the following attributes:
     {'color': 'green', 'shape': 'ellipse'}
    A(n) strawberry has the following attributes:
     {'color': 'red', 'shape': 'rounded-edge cone'}



```python
%%js

const personName = "Shaurya";
const age = 15;

const favoriteThings = {
    flavor: "Chocolate",
    snacks: "pringles",
    food: "tacos",
    drink: "fanta",
}

favoriteThings.food = "burger";
console.log(personName + " likes to eat " + favoriteThings.food + " and drink " + favoriteThings.drink);
```


```python
%%js

let fibonacci = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13];
let peopleInGroup = ["Arnav", "Ehren", "Lars", "Shaurya", "Weston"];
console.log(peopleInGroup + " are the members in our group, but anyway, here are the first few fibonacci sequence numbers: " + fibonacci)
```

### Homework Hacks 5-6


```python
%%js

// declare constants for personal info that can't change
const personName = "Shaurya";
const grade = 11;
const isIndian = true;

// declare let for temprary information that can change
let favActivity = "cycling";

// use function with parameters to print out a sentence using all the const and let variables
function printStatement(var1, var2, var3, var4) {
    console.log("My name is " + personName + ". I am in " + grade + "th grade and it is " + isIndian + " that I am Indian and like " + favActivity);
}

printStatement(personName, grade, isIndian, favActivity)

```


```python
print("Calculate your average grade!")

#create variable with no value to add all the grades to
sum_of_grades = 0
#create a counter to keep track of how many grades the user entered, start from 1 to account for the first class's grade
grade_counter = 1

#ask the grade for the first class and add it to empty variable
grade1 = int(input("Enter your first class's grade: "))
sum_of_grades += grade1

#ask the grade for the following classes (can be any number of classes)
while True: #use while loop to add as many grades as user wants
    grade_next = int(input("Enter your next class's grade, enter -1 when you're done: "))
    if grade_next == -1: #use if else statement, the student enters -1 the while loop stops and when they enter a regular grade the loop continues
        break
    else:
        sum_of_grades += grade_next #add the grade value to the first class's grade
        grade_counter += 1 #counts an additional grade each time

print("The average grade you have is", int(sum_of_grades / grade_counter), "percent.") #get the integer of the sum of all your grades divided by the number of grades you inputted
```

    Calculate your average grade!
    The average grade you have is 90 percent.
