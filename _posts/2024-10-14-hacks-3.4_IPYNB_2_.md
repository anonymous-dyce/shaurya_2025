### Popcorn Hack 7


```python
lyrics = '''
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do'''

words = lyrics.split() #each word within the lyrics
lines = lyrics.split('\n') #each line

print(words.count("happy"), "\n") #counts how many times "happy" appears

baby_index = words.index("baby") + 1  # Adding 1 for 1-based index

print("The word 'baby' is word number", baby_index, "in the song.")

print(lyrics.replace(lines[1], lines[-1]), "\n") #replaces the first verse with the last (index #-1) verse

print(lines[6] + ", " + lines[3]) #concatenates the two verses

```

    The word 'baby' is word number 35 in the song.
    
    Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
    Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
    I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
    With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
    Because I'm happy
    Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
    Because I'm happy
    Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
    Because I'm happy
    Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
    Because I'm happy
    Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do 
    
    Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof, I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space


### Popcorn Hack 8


```python
%%js

const flower = "Tulip";
const animal = "Horse";
const creature = `${flower} + ${animal} = Turse`;

// Story about the new creature
const creatureName = "Turse";
const creatureDescription = "a creature with the body of a horse and the head of a tulip (facing in the same direction as its nose";
const story = `
Once upon a time, there was a creature named ${creatureName}.

It was ${creatureDescription}. It loved to be in the sun, and had a mouth in the middle of its ${flower}-head that could eat grass.

However, it never wanted to show himself to others because it feared he would get made fun of.

One day, there was a hunter searching for deers in the forest. As ${creatureName} went for a stroll, the hunter found it!!!

He captured ${creatureName} and took it to his warehouse, where he thought of killing and examining it. In the warehouse, it met other animals, and they were awestruck to see it!

They asked it several questions and it told them that it needed to escape the warehouse. The animals agreed because they thought ${creatureName} was very rare and needed to be free.

They showed it a window only one animal (or creature) could escape from, and it thanked them and quickly escaped, just before the hunter came back into the shed.

${creatureName} realized that everyone loved it and it shouldn't have been scared of others making fun of it. To be continued...

console.log(creature);
console.log(story);

### Main strings hack


```python
import math
sentence = input("Enter a sentence (without punctuation): ") #processes everything as string

tot_char = len(sentence) #counts total characters

wo_spaces = sentence.replace(" ", "")
lowercase = sentence.lower()
uppercase = sentence.upper()

longest_word = "" #the default longest word has no letters
words = sentence.split()
for i in words:
    if len(i) >= len(longest_word): #if the length of the first word (and consecutive words) is greater than the previous longest word
        longest_word = i #it becomes the new longest word

reversed = sentence[::-1] #reverses string

mid_word1 = words[math.ceil(len(words) / 2)]
mid_word2 = words[math.ceil(len(words) / 2) - 1]

def average_len(): #unique function
    tot_len = 0
    for j in words:
        tot_len += len(j)
    return int(tot_len / len(words))

print("The sentence:", sentence, "\n")
print("Total number of characters, including spaces:", tot_char, "\n")
print("Longest word:", longest_word, "\nLength of longest word:", len(longest_word))
print("Reversed string:", reversed)
if len(words) % 2 == 1:
    print("The middle word is:", mid_word2)
else:
    print(f"the middle words are: {mid_word2} and {mid_word1}")
print("The average length of all words in the string are:", average_len())

replace = input("\nEnter a word you want to replace: ") #bonus
if replace in sentence:
    new = input("Enter the new word: ")
    updated = sentence.replace(replace, new)
    print("Updated string:", updated)
else:
    print(f"The word '{replace}' is not in the original string.")
```

    The sentence: Hello how are you 
    
    Total number of characters, including spaces: 17 
    
    Longest word: Hello 
    Length of longest word: 5
    Reversed string: uoy era woh olleH
    the middle words are: how and are
    The average length of all words in the string are: 3
    Updated string: Hello how are humans like



```python
%%js

const sentence = prompt("Enter a sentence (without punctuation): ");

const withoutSpaces = sentence.replace(" ", "")
const lowercase = sentence.toLowerCase()
const uppercase = sentence.toUpperCase()

const words = sentence.split(" "); // Split the sentence into words
let longestWord = ""; // Initialize an empty string for the longest word
for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    if (words[i].length >= longestWord.length) { // Check if the current word is longer
        longestWord = words[i]; // Update longestWord
    }
}

const reversedString = input.split('').reverse().join('');

const n = words.length; // Get the number of words
let midWord1, midWord2;

if (n % 2 === 0) { // Check if the number of words is even
    midWord1 = words[Math.ceil(n / 2) - 1]; // First middle word
    midWord2 = words[Math.ceil(n / 2)]; // Second middle word
} else { // If odd, just find the middle word
    midWord1 = words[Math.floor(n / 2)];
    midWord2 = null; // No second middle word
}

function averageLen(words) { //unique function
    let totalLength = 0;

    for (let j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
        totalLength += words[j].length;
    }

    return Math.floor(totalLength / words.length); // Return the average length as an integer
}

console.log("The sentence:", sentence);
console.log("Total number of characters, including spaces:", totalCharacters);
console.log("Longest word:", longestWord, "\nLength of longest word:", longestWord.length);
console.log("Reversed string:", reversedString);
if (words.length % 2 === 1) {
    console.log("The middle word is:", midWord);
} else {
    console.log("The middle words are:", midWord1, "and", midWord2);
}
console.log("The average length of all words in the string is:", averageLen(words));
